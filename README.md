### Hi, I'm Johannes 👋

I am studying Software Engineering 👨‍💻 @ CODE University in Berlin.

Experience in developing REST/RPC APIs with **Golang** on **AWS**. Also using **React**, Redux, Webpack, SCSS and GraphQL on the Frontend. I am always excited to learn new skills: **Flutter**, Elm and a never-ending supply of AWS Services 😉

I am currently looking for a job in Berlin, [write me an email](mailto:johannes@joina.de?subject=I%20might%20have%20a%20job%20for%20you.&body=Hi%20Johannes%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A...) 📫
